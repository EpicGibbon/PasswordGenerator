# PasswordGenerator
My first functional JavaScript application!

To start off the project I had to give each of the requirments their own variable so the user can select what requirements they wanted.

Once we got the variables set we then need to confirm with the user what specific parameters they want met. 

Once the user inputs what parameters they want to be met, the application will then isolate what variables they want into the generator and it will start to generate.

Used If and else statements to return values based on what the user input.
